# About Eufemia

## The Vision

<Blockquote className="dnb-blockquote">
Eufemia empowers us to efficiently innovate and create holistic world class experiences
</Blockquote>

Eufemia is [DNB's](https://www.dnb.no/) design system, which consists of resources for designers and developers to maintain consistency and efficiency when building accessible web applications. The goal is to have a single source of truth for design through color, typography, and layout guidelines as well as fully coded components to use in applications.

### For everyone

With Eufemia, DNB can continually increase the product quality for both visual users and users relying on assistive technologies. It follows the industry and regulatory standards [UU Tilsynet](https://www.uutilsynet.no/) alongside with [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

You can read more about what we at DNB UX expect and define as the minimal [accessibility requirements](/uilib/usage/accessibility) for our web applications.
