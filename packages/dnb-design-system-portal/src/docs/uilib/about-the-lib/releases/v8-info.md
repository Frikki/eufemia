## Migration

v8 contains a couple of _braking changes_. As a migration process, you can simply search and replace:

## Changes

1. The `figure` HTML got included in the CSS reset with a `margin: 0`.
1. Add TypeScript type declarations for component PropTypes.

## Install

To upgrade to v8 with NPM, use:

```bash
$ npm i dnb-ui-lib@8
```
